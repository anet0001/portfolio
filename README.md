# Nonso Anetoh Desmond - Web Dev II - Portfolio

## Project Explanation

This is the repository for my Web Development II Portfolio Project at Algonquin College.

### Challenges

- Development Process and Challenges:
  During the development of my web portfolio, I encountered a challenge related to incorporating animations without relying heavily on JavaScript. This challenge prompted me to explore alternative solutions, leading me to become more familiar with Bootstrap.

### Lessons Learned

- To address the animation challenge without using JavaScript extensively, I delved into the capabilities of Bootstrap. Bootstrap is a front-end framework that provides a variety of pre-built components and utilities. I found that Bootstrap's built-in classes and components allowed me to implement subtle animations and transitions without the need for extensive JavaScript code. This approach not only simplified the development process but also enhanced the overall performance and responsiveness of my portfolio.

- In summary, my journey in developing my web portfolio taught me to leverage the capabilities of frameworks like Bootstrap to overcome challenges, specifically in implementing animations without relying extensively on JavaScript. This experience reinforced the idea that a well-chosen framework can contribute to a more efficient and effective development process.
